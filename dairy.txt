Before the bell. Jerome Powell was quite dovish in his latest testimony in Congress, Mr. Market's rate cut optimism would look premature if CPI and PPI reports show inflation getting sticky well above the Fed's target rate of 2%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs that the central bank is "not far" from being ready to make rate reductions. Economists, on average, see February's CPI rising 0.4% from a month ago, up from January’s 0.3% increase. On a year-over-year basis, the index is expected to advance 3.1%, unchanged from the previous month's print, but still above the Fed's 2% goal. In Asia, Japan -0.1%. Hong Kong +3.1%. China -0.4%.

10/03/24 - 17/03/24. The S&P 500 fell Friday and posted its second-straight weekly loss, with tech stocks particularly feeling the heat as inflation concerns linger ahead of next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting. Wall Street wasn't deterred after the latest consumer inflation report did little to alter market expectations of interest rate cuts. The Consumer Price Index advanced 0.4% M/M in February, as expected, and slightly accelerated from January's 0.3% rise. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.4% M/M, a tad higher than the anticipated figure of +0.3%.
